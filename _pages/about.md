I earned my PhD degree from the University of Hong Kong (HKU), co-supervised by [Prof. Jia Pan](https://sites.google.com/site/panjia) and [Prof. Chaoyang Song](https://bionicdl.ancorasir.com). My research interests include embodied intelligence, computational design, kinematic analysis, motion control, and reinforcement learning.

My current works try to address the key questions in the structure design problem of embodied intelligence since there are still open questions of which robotic configuration would have the best performance among numerous design principles and task requirements. The proposed computational design frameworks in my studies aim at optimizing the configuration, design parameters, and geometric structures of generalized embodied design for specific tasks, as well as providing instructive insights for designers determining the embodied robotic configurations and parameters in the early stage of the design process.

While further research explorations focus on leveraging the deep reinforcement learning technique to obtain the embodied intelligence with enhanced performance, including intelligent control policies and task-adaptable configurations.
